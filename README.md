# NLP Capstone Project

## üìù Overview
This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using Keras and TensorFlow. The goal is to build and evaluate an NLP model for Ecommence text classification, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and tracking performance using TensorBoard and MLflow.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project consists of textual data for classification tasks.
- The data includes labeled samples that are preprocessed and prepared for model training.

---

## Preprocessing
1. Imported necessary libraries and datasets.
2. Cleaned and tokenized text data.
3. Removed stopwords using **NLTK**.
4. Encoded categorical labels using **scikit-learn**.

---

## NLP
1. Applied tokenization and padding to standardize input sequences.
2. Built a vocabulary using the Keras `Tokenizer`.
3. Used word embeddings for better text representation.

---

## Model
1. Developed a deep learning model using **Keras** with **TensorFlow** backend.
2. Model structure:
   - Embedding layer
   - Convolutional and LSTM layers for feature extraction
   - Fully connected layers for classification
3. Optimized with appropriate loss functions, regularization, and callbacks.

---

## Results
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Tracked and tuned model performance using **MLflow**.
- Visualized training and validation performance.

---

## TensorBoard
- Used TensorBoard to monitor:
   - Loss and accuracy curves  
   - Model architecture  
   - Confusion matrix  

---

## Future Improvement
- Explore additional NLP models (e.g., transformers).  
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.  
- Increase training dataset size for improved generalization.
